This folder contains patches for HaProxy to work with wolfSSL. Patches make it
easier to add support for newer versions of a target library. The format of
the patch names is:
    <year>-<month>-<day>-<commit that the patch was implemented and tested on>.patch
The date in the patch name corresponds to the date of the commit that the
patch was implemented and tested on to make choosing the appropriate patch
easier. Instructions for applying each patch are included in the patch commit
message.

The test directory implements some of the *.vtc HaProxy reg-tests. These
allow each component to be manually run and examined for errors. Most importantly,
this allows us to plug gdb into the haproxy binary.

Prerequisites:

The below must be installed in order to use HaProxy.This was done on 
Ubuntu 22.04.
