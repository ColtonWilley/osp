wolfSSL into lighty!

lighttpd 1.4.56 and later provide lighttpd mod_wolfssl with native support
for wolfSSL.  Using the most recent lighttpd stable release is recommended.

For older lighttpd releases, see README files in:
`./lighttpd-1.4.35/wolfStartup/README`
`./lighttpd-1.4.49/wolfStartup/README`
`./lighttpd-1.4.50/wolfStartup/README`

Aside: a prior mistake labelled the lighttpd-1.4.50 release as lighttpd-1.4.51
in this repository.  The directory has been renamed, but to avoid breaking
links, a symlink has been created from lighttpd-1.4.51 -> lighttpd-1.4.50.
