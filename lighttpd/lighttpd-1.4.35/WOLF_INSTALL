These install instructions are for use of lighttpd with wolfSSL.

In the wolfSSL tdl:
    ./configure --disable-shared --enable-opensslextra --enable-fastmath
    make
    sudo make install

In lighttpd tdl:
    ./configure --with-openssl --with-openssl-includes=/usr/local/include --with-openssl-libs=/usr/local/lib

You'll have to edit the src/Makefile as follows:
    SSL_LIB = -lssl -lcrypto => SSL_LIB = -lwolfssl
    CRYPT_LIB = =>  CRYPT_LIB = -lwolfssl
    -I/usr/local/include => -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include/wolfssl

To enable changes we've made to the lighttpd source code, add the following
define to tdl/config.h (I added it directly under HAVE_OPENSSL_SSL_H):
    #define HAVE_WOLFSSL_SSL_H 1

Also add the following include to lighttpd's: tdl/src/settings.h:
    #include <wolfssl/options.h>

Now make install from the lighttpd tdl:
    make
    sudo make install

Notes if you have problems with liblightcomp:

Below is a diff of my src/Makefile before and after the changes (all changes
including the ones mentioned above) I made to get lighttpd to compile against
wolfssl.  The important thing is to get rid of liblightcomp throughout the
Makefile, and uncomment the alternative.
