This folder contains patches for cjose to work with wolfSSL. Patches make it
easier to add support for newer versions of a target library. The format of
the patch names is:
    <year>-<month>-<day>-<commit that the patch was implemented and tested on>.patch
The date in the patch name corresponds to the date of the commit that the
patch was implemented and tested on to make choosing the appropriate patch
easier. Instructions for applying each patch are included in the patch commit
message.
