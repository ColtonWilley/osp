This folder contains patches for bind9 to work with wolfSSL. Patches make it
easier to add support for newer versions of a target library. The format of
the patch names is:
    <version that the patch was implemented and tested on>.patch
Instructions for applying each patch are included in the patch commit message.

To run the bind9 tests locally, the following Dockerfile is helpful:

```

ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

RUN apt-get -y update
RUN apt-get -y upgrade
RUN apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev git gcc libpcre2-dev zlib1g-dev make autoconf libtool wget bsdmainutils net-tools gdbserver valgrind pkg-config
