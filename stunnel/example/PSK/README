How to run everything:
Install wolf as per instructions
install open as per instructions

Make in the wolfExamples directory
in same run tcp client thus:
./client-tcp 127.0.0.1
and server:
./server-tcp

(list ports these things connect to)



Another thing: the key is read in as a string, so if you go back to 
wolfssl-examples, you have to do a strcopy, rather than using bytes.

Tutorial taken from here: https://www.stunnel.org/auth.html

To enable psk: enable with wolf, and also comment out this line in stunnel
src/common.h: #define OPENSSL_NO_PSK then everything should run.
