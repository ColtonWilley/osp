PPP v2.4.5 EAP-TLS with CyaSSL v2.0.8
-------------------------------------

This project started with ppp-2.4.5 as the base. It does not have EAP-TLS
support. That is supplied by a set of patches on top of the sources. CyaSSL
is applied as a patch on top of the patches.

The repository has two commits. First is the original ppp sources with the
EAP-TLS v0.992 patch applied. (commit 5e13f6b) Next commit has the
modifiction where OpenSSL is ripped out and replaced with CyaSSL.
(commit f5d2954)

The original ppp-2.4.5 can be found at the Samba website. The EAP-TLS
patches can be found at Jan Just Keijser's website.
