PPP v2.4.5 EAP-TLS with wolfSSL
-------------------------------------

This project started with ppp-2.4.5 as the base. It does not have EAP-TLS
support. That is supplied by a set of patches on top of the sources. wolfSSL
is applied as a patch on top of the patches.

To build PPP, first configure wolfSSL as shown below.

```./configure --enable-opensslextra --enable-fortress --enable-dh --enable-des3 CFLAGS=-DWOLFSSL_DES_ECB'```

Then ```make``` and ```sudo make install```.

Then build PPP with ```./configure``` then ```make```.

The repository has three commits. First is the original ppp sources with the
EAP-TLS v0.992 patch applied. (commit 5e13f6b) Next commit has the
modifiction where OpenSSL is ripped out and replaced with CyaSSL.
(commit f5d2954) The last commit updates the port to build with wolfSSL.

The original ppp-2.4.5 can be found at the Samba website. The EAP-TLS
patches can be found at Jan Just Keijser's website.
