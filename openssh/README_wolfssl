To add the support of WolfSSL library replacing OpenSSL functions, configure
and compile wolfSSL library by doing:

 $ ./configure --enable-dsa --enable-opensslextra --enable-dh --enable-ecc \
   --enable-sha512 --enable-ripemd --enable-fortress --enable-nullcipher \
   --enable-arc4
 $ make
 $ make check
 $ make install

Compile OpenSSH from the current configuration using:

 $ ./configure --with-pam --with-wolfssl
 $ make

For testing, replace the ssh-keygen with one compiled from the original code
with OpenSSL, after call:

 $ make tests

You must have at the end of the testuite the message 'all tests passed'.

Notes:
  - two tests are not working at this time : 'forwarding' and 'connect-privsep'
  - only the protocol version 2 is supported with wolfSSL
