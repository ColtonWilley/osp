To add the support of WolfSSL library replacing OpenSSL functions, configure and compile wolfSSL library by doing :
./configure --enable-dsa --enable-opensslextra --enable-dh --enable-ecc --enable-sha512 --enable-ripemd --enable-fortress --enable-nullcipher --enable-arc4
make
make test
make install

compile OpenSSH from the current configuration using :
cp openssh-6.6p1-wolfssl_configure configure
cp openssh-6.6p1-wolfssl_configure.ac configure.ac
./configure --with-pam --with-wolfssl=<PATH of wolfSSL> --with-ssldir=""
patch -p0 < openssh-6.6p1-patch-config.h
patch -p0 < openssh-6.6p1-patch-Makefile
make

Notes:
  - it is not possible to use the make tests of OpenSSH as the support is not complete at this time
  - only the protocol version 2 is supported with wolfSSL
  - some tests can be done using sshd and ssh directly
