To add the support of WolfSSL library replacing OpenSSL functions, configure and compile wolfSSL library by doing :
./configure --enable-dsa --enable-opensslextra --enable-dh --enable-ecc --enable-sha512 --enable-ripemd --enable-fortress --enable-nullcipher
make
make test
make install

compile OpenSSH from the current configuration using :
make ssh
make sshd

Notes:
  - it is not possible to use the make tests of OpenSSH as the support is not complete at this time
  - only the protocol version 2 is supported with wolfSSL
  - some tests can be done using sshd and ssh directly
