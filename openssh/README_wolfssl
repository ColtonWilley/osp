To add the support of WolfSSL library replacing OpenSSL functions, configure and compile wolfSSL library by doing :
./configure --enable-dsa --enable-opensslextra --enable-dh --enable-ecc --enable-sha512 --enable-ripemd --enable-fortress --enable-nullcipher --enable-arc4
make
make test
make install

compile OpenSSH from the current configuration using :
cp openssh-6.6p1-wolfssl_configure configure
cp openssh-6.6p1-wolfssl_configure.ac configure.ac
./configure --with-pam --with-wolfssl=<PATH of wolfSSL> --with-ssl-dir=""
patch -p0 < openssh-6.6p1-patch-config.h
patch -p0 < openssh-6.6p1-patch-Makefile
make

For testing, replace the ssh-keygen with one compiled from the original code with OpenSSL, after call :
make tests

You must have at the end of the testuite the message 'all tests passed'

Notes:
  - two tests are not working at this time : 'forwarding' and 'connect-privsep'
  - only the protocol version 2 is supported with wolfSSL
